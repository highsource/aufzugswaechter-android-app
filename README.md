[Download the latest APK](https://github.com/highsource/aufzugswaechter-android-app/releases/download/1.0.1/aufzugswaechter-1.0.1.apk).

# Installation

This is an early prototype, so you'll need to activate installation of apps from unknown sources on your Android device:

* Go to `Settings`
* Select `Security`
* Check `Unknown sources` > `Allow installation of apps from sources other than the Play Store`
* Click `OK`
* 
# Usage

## Map

## Markers

TBD

## Scanning the QR-Code

You can select a facility by scanning a QR code.

* Click the QR-Code scan in the toolbar
* Scan a QR-Code
* The map will navigate to the facility and open the info window where you can subscribe to or unsubscribe from updates

The QR-Code may be any string ending with `#<facilityEquipmentnumber>`. For instance, the following image encodes the URL `http://www.aufzugswaechter.org/#10213788` and will take you to the facility with the equipment number `10213788` (`Armdstadt Hbf: Aufzug zu Bstg 2/3`).
